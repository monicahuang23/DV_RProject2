For our project, we extracted data concerning general information of hospitals in the United States. 

The code that we used to extract, transform, and load the data into an sql statement is as follows: 

```{r}
source("../01 Data/R_ETL.R", echo = TRUE)
```

We imported the CVS file into a table in SQL.  

Then, we used the code below to display a subset of data for hospitals in Travis County, Texas. 
```{r}
source ("../01 Data/Titanic Analysis.R", echo = TRUE)
```
